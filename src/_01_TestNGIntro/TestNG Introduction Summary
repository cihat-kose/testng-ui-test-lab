Topic: TestNG Introduction

Summary:

TestNG is an open-source test automation framework for Java.
TestNG (Test Next Generation) was developed to address the shortcomings
of other test frameworks like JUnit and NUnit.

Key features of TestNG:
1. Test management using annotations.
2. Ability to execute tests in parallel.
3. Exception handling and customizable method execution order.
4. Test scenario configuration using XML (testng.xml).
5. Easy management of test groups and dependent test methods.
6. Rich reporting support.

Compared to JUnit, TestNG provides more flexibility and a wider set of features.
It is especially beneficial in large-scale projects for grouping numerous test methods,
running tests in parallel, and generating detailed reports.
