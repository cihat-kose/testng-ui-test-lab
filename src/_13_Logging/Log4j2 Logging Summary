Topic: Logging Configuration with Log4j2

Summary:

Log4j2 is a powerful logging library that allows you to log messages in your applications.
Logs can be written to both the console and files. Logging levels determine how messages are categorized based on their severity.

Logging Levels:
- ALL: Captures all levels of logs.
- DEBUG: Provides detailed information for debugging purposes.
- INFO: Contains general informational messages.
- WARN: Indicates potential issues.
- ERROR: Records application errors.
- FATAL: Indicates critical errors.
- OFF: Turns off logging.

Log4j2 is typically configured using an XML file where the logging behavior and targets are defined.

Example Configuration:
1. `Appenders`: Define the destinations where logs will be written (e.g., console, file).
2. `Loggers`: Define which logging levels to use and which appenders to attach.

Basic Configuration Steps:
- Define `Console` and `File` appenders to log messages to both destinations.
- The `Root` element sets the log level and specifies which appenders will be used.
