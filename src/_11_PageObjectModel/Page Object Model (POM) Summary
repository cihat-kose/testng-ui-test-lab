Topic: Page Object Model (POM)

Summary:

Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern used in software testing that promotes creating separate classes for each web page or sections of a page.
This improves the structure, readability, maintainability, and reusability of test code.

What POM provides:

1. Page Object Classes:
   - Each web page or page section is represented by a class containing web elements and related operations.
   - Example:
     public class LoginPage {
         @FindBy(id = "username") WebElement usernameInput;
         @FindBy(id = "password") WebElement passwordInput;

         public void setUsername(String username) {
             usernameInput.sendKeys(username);
         }
     }

2. Using Page Objects in Tests:
   - Test classes interact with page objects instead of directly with WebDriver.
   - Example:
     LoginPage loginPage = new LoginPage(driver);
     loginPage.setUsername("standard_user");

3. Maintainability and Reusability:
   - Changes in the page structure only require updates in the page object class.
   - The same page objects can be reused across multiple test cases.

4. Cleaner and More Understandable Tests:
   - Page logic is separated from test logic.
   - Test code focuses only on test scenarios and validations.

Conclusion:
Page Object Model helps reduce code duplication and increases modularity.
It supports scalable, cleaner, and more maintainable test automation frameworks especially in large-scale projects.
