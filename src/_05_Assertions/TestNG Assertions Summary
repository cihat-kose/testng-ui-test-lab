Topic: TestNG Assertions

Summary:

TestNG assertions are used to verify whether tests have passed or failed.
Assertions are essential tools for validating expected outcomes in test cases.
If an assertion fails, the test is marked as failed and a corresponding error message is thrown.

There are two main types of assertions in TestNG:

1. Hard Assert:
   - Immediately stops test execution if the assertion fails.
   - Belongs to the Assert class in TestNG.
   - Example: Assert.assertEquals(actual, expected);

2. Soft Assert:
   - Allows the test to continue even if an assertion fails.
   - Useful when multiple conditions need to be checked within a single test.
   - Belongs to the SoftAssert class in TestNG.
   - Example: softAssert.assertEquals(actual, expected);

Commonly Used Assertions in TestNG:

- Assert.assertEquals(): Verifies that two values are equal.
- Assert.assertNotEquals(): Verifies that two values are not equal.
- Assert.assertTrue(): Checks if a condition is true.
- Assert.assertFalse(): Checks if a condition is false.
- Assert.assertNull(): Checks if the object is null.
- Assert.assertNotNull(): Checks if the object is not null.

Using SoftAssert:
With SoftAssert, all assertions are executed until the end of the test.
To evaluate them collectively, the `assertAll()` method must be called.

In short, assertions ensure the correctness of test outcomes.
Hard Assert stops the test on failure, while Soft Assert allows it to continue.
