Topic: HTML Reporting

Summary:

TestNG provides the capability to report test results in an HTML format.
These reports include detailed information about which tests passed or failed, along with error messages.

TestNGâ€™s default reporting mechanism automatically generates HTML reports after test execution.
These reports are located in the `test-output` directory and can be viewed via the `index.html` file.

To create custom reports, the `ITestListener` interface can also be used.
This interface allows tracking of test events such as start, success, or failure, offering flexibility in generating customized HTML reports.

- Default HTML Report:
  - TestNG automatically generates the `index.html` file under the `test-output` folder. This report includes:
    - Names and results of tests (PASSED, FAILED, SKIPPED)
    - Error messages and stack traces
    - Test execution duration

- Custom Reports:
  - Reports can be customized using the `ITestListener` interface.
  - With this interface, it is possible to obtain test status information and tailor the reports accordingly.

In summary, HTML reports provide a clear and visual representation of test results.
The default reports are usually sufficient, but custom reports can be created when needed.
