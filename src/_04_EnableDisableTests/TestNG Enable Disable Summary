Topic: TestNG Enable/Disable Annotations

Summary:

In TestNG, annotations like `enabled` and `@Ignore` are used to control whether a test method should be executed.
These are helpful when you want to temporarily disable or skip certain test methods.

1. @Test(enabled = true / false):
   - By default, all test methods are enabled (`enabled = true`).
   - You can use `enabled = false` to temporarily disable a test method.
   - Disabled tests are not executed and may appear as "skipped" in test reports.

2. @Ignore (TestNG):
   - A TestNG annotation used to skip a test method.
   - Functionally similar to `enabled = false`.
   - Provides a shorter and more readable syntax, preferred in some cases.

Note: These annotations are useful when managing unfinished or temporarily unnecessary test cases in larger test scenarios.
