Topic: TestNG Annotations

Summary:

In the TestNG framework, tests are managed using various annotations.
These annotations control when and how each test method is executed.
Below are the key annotations used in TestNG:

1. @BeforeSuite:
   - Runs once before the entire test suite.
     Useful for global setup tasks before any tests start.

2. @BeforeTest:
   - Runs before any test methods belonging to the <test> tag in testng.xml.

3. @BeforeGroups:
   - Runs before the first test method of specified groups.

4. @BeforeClass:
   - Runs once before the first test method in the current class.

5. @BeforeMethod:
   - Runs before each test method.
     Commonly used for setting up preconditions.

6. @Test:
   - Marks a method as a test to be executed by TestNG.

7. @AfterMethod:
   - Runs after each test method.
     Commonly used for cleanup tasks.

8. @AfterClass:
   - Runs once after all test methods in the current class.

9. @AfterGroups:
   - Runs after the last test method of specified groups.

10. @AfterTest:
    - Runs after all test methods in the <test> tag have run.

11. @AfterSuite:
    - Runs once after the entire test suite.
      Suitable for final cleanup or reporting tasks.

These annotations allow you to define the execution order, dependencies,
and structure of your tests clearly and efficiently.
