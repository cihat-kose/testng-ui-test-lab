Subject: Cross Browser Testing

Summary:

Cross Browser Testing is the process of verifying that a web application works correctly across different web browsers.
By using Selenium WebDriver together with TestNG, the same test scenarios can be executed on multiple browsers.

Key activities in Cross Browser Testing:

1. Running Tests on Multiple Browsers:
   - Execute the same tests on different browsers to verify browser compatibility of the application.
   - For example, running the same scenario on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.

2. Managing Browser Parameters via XML:
   - Browser types can be defined in the XML configuration file, allowing control over which browser the test should run on.
   - Example:
     <parameter name="browser" value="chrome"/>

3. Browser-Independent Tests:
   - Tests can be designed to be browser-agnostic, so that the same code can run on different browser drivers.
   - By utilizing WebDriver, consistency across browser versions is ensured.

Supported Browsers for Cross Browser Testing:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Safari

Conclusion:
Cross Browser Testing ensures that web applications behave consistently across all supported browsers.
By managing browser parameters through XML, the same tests can be automatically executed across different environments.
