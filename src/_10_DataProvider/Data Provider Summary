Topic: Testing with Data Providers

Summary:

In TestNG, a "Data Provider" is used to run the same test multiple times with different sets of input data.
This feature allows parameterized execution of test methods with dynamic and flexible test data.

Data Provider:
- Defined using the @DataProvider annotation.
- Runs the same test method repeatedly with different data sets.
- Each data set is passed as parameters to the test method.
- The test method is linked to the data provider via @Test(dataProvider = "dataProviderName").

Usage:

1. Define multiple data sets with @DataProvider:

@DataProvider(name = "loginCredentials")
public Object[][] loginCredentials() {
    return new Object[][] {
        {"user1@example.com", "password1"},
        {"user2@example.com", "password2"},
        {"user3@example.com", "password3"}
    };
}

2. Use @Test(dataProvider = "loginCredentials") to execute the test with all data sets:

@Test(dataProvider = "loginCredentials")
public void loginTest(String username, String password) {
    System.out.println("Login Test for: " + username);
}

This allows you to run the same login test using different usernames and passwords.

In summary, Data Providers enable data-driven testing and make it easier to repeat tests with different input values.
Unlike @Parameters, the data is dynamically supplied from code, allowing for greater flexibility.
