Topic: TestNG Priority-Sorting

Summary:

TestNG allows setting the execution order of test methods using priorities.
By applying the @Test(priority = x) annotation, you can assign priority to test methods.
Methods without a specified priority are executed first, in alphabetical order.

1. Methods Without Priority:
   - If no priority is assigned, TestNG executes the method before all priority-defined ones,
     based on alphabetical order.

2. Methods With Priority:
   - Methods with assigned priority are executed in order from the lowest number to the highest.
     Lower values indicate higher priority.

This feature is useful when you want your test cases to run in a specific sequence,
especially for managing test dependencies properly.
